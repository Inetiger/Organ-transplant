# Organ transplant

A mostly scripted program, one person has no kidneys, but has a friend with both of his intact, so I made a game out of it, there might be a problem where i only swith on of the kidneys but if you only want to save them you can. Not much more to add other that, it was the first time i got in a bad conversation with my group because they had the idea, that it was important to be able to color the console. In my mind i don't think a business is to focused on what color you console is.
